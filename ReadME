This repository contains the implementation of a Movie Recommender System, designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. The project leverages various recommendation algorithms to provide personalized movie recommendations, enhancing user experience by guiding them to content they are likely to enjoy.

Project Overview
In the age of information overload, finding the right movie to watch can be overwhelming. This Movie Recommender System aims to solve this problem by filtering and suggesting movies that align with a user's tastes. The system utilizes a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to generate recommendations, balancing between user similarity and movie attributes.

Key Features
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Utilized popular movie datasets (e.g., MovieLens) containing user ratings, movie metadata, and tags. Performed data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction to prepare the data for modeling.
Collaborative Filtering: Implemented both User-Based and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering techniques. The system recommends movies by identifying similar users or items based on rating patterns.
Content-Based Filtering: Developed a model that recommends movies based on the similarity of movie attributes such as genres, cast, and directors to the user's previously liked movies.
Hybrid Model: Combined the strengths of collaborative and content-based filtering into a hybrid model to enhance recommendation accuracy.
Evaluation: Assessed the performance of the recommender system using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on a test set. Additionally, top-N recommendation accuracy was evaluated to gauge the model's effectiveness in suggesting relevant movies.
User Interface: Built a simple command-line or web-based interface to allow users to input their preferences and receive movie recommendations.
Results
The recommender system was able to provide personalized movie suggestions with a high degree of accuracy. The hybrid approach effectively captured both the preferences of users with similar tastes and the content-specific attributes of movies, resulting in more diverse and relevant recommendations.

Future Enhancements
Incorporating more advanced models like Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD) and deep learning-based recommender systems for further improvements.
Expanding the system to include contextual information such as time of day or mood to offer more context-aware recommendations.
Developing a more sophisticated user interface with additional features like filtering by genre, year, or actor.
Technologies Used
